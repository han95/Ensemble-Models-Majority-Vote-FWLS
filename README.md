# Ensemble-Models-Majority-Vote-FWLS
A Python framework for building majority vote and feature weighted linear stacking (FWLS) ensemble models.  As an example, ensemble models are built to classify flower species of the Iris dataset.  The models in the ensembles are a support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and k nearest neighbor.
